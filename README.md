# Exploratory_data_analysis

##Introduction
Conduct your own exploratory data analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set of your choice.

The analysis should be almost like a stream-of-consciousness as you ask questions, create visualizations, and explore your data.
